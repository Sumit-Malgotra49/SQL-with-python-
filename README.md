TASK 7: Get Basic Sales Summary from a Tiny SQLite Database using Python
Objective
This project demonstrates how to use Python (with sqlite3, pandas, and matplotlib) to connect to an SQLite database and pull basic sales data, including total quantity sold and total revenue. It will then display the data using simple print statements and a basic bar chart.

Tools
Python (with sqlite3, pandas, and matplotlib libraries)

SQLite (built into Python — no setup required)

Jupyter Notebook or Python script (.py file)

Dataset
You’ll work with a small SQLite database file (sales_data.db) that contains a sales table. The table includes sales data such as product, quantity sold, and price per item.

Deliverables
Python script (or Jupyter Notebook) that:

Connects to sales_data.db

Runs 1-2 basic SQL queries

Displays the query results using:

Print statements

A basic matplotlib bar chart
